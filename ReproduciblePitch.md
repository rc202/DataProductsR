Introduction
========================================================

This is the pitch for the Shiny App developed for the Data Products in R course project. The App looks at the Nitrous Oxide pollution levels in London in 2017.

- It allows the user to interactively view the amount of NO pollution per hour for each day of the month selected. 

- The bar chart displays the varying amount of NO for each hour when the sliders are moved for each day of the month selected.
